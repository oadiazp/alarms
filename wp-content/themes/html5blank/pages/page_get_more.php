                                    1. <b>Backup Doorbell</b> &ndash; Anytime anyone goes through the front door, your security system can chime. Even better, get a notification on your phone! If you have a screen, glass or another type of exterior door, consider putting the Door Window Sensor there. You may not hear a guest knocking, but you’ll hear the chime and notification!<br>
<br>
2. <b>Mail Notification</b> &ndash; No more waiting around for the mailman. Know exactly when the mail arrives each day, by attaching a sensor to your mailbox. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
3. <b>Guard the Shed </b>&ndash;<b>&nbsp;</b>In addition to placing Door Window Sensors on the doors to your home, put one on the outdoor shed if you have one and if it’s within range of your Control Panel. The range can be checked upon activation or on your online account. Sheds often contain valuable equipment, but the biggest concern is that the tools can be used to break into your home.

                                    There are many ways in which Frontpoint’s interactive features can keep you connected. With a variety of alerts, you’ll never be out of sync with your home and system. You can set each of these alerts quickly and easily via MyFrontpoint.com.<br>
<br>
1. <b>Arming Reminders</b> &ndash; Find yourself rushing out of the house most mornings? It’s easy to forget things here and there, including arming your system. These reminders ensure you’ll never leave your home unarmed again.<br>
<br>
2. <b>User Codes</b> &ndash; A big part of peace of mind is knowing who comes and goes from your home. Simply assign each family member a user code and you’ll be alerted when they enter the home.<br>
<br>
3. <b>No-Show Alerts</b> &ndash; Sometimes it’s not just about knowing who shows up when, but rather who doesn’t. For example, if your child doesn't return from school, you'll be notified.

                                </h3>

                                    A Frontpoint system always gives you complete protection, which is always a good thing. However, there are times you may want a little less coverage for certain areas. Let’s say you want to be able to freely open and close a window during the night without risking a false alarm, or you’re having a renovation done on a certain area of your home that will require workers coming and going or a sensor to be temporarily displaced. Luckily, bypassing certain sensors is simple.<br>
<br>
<strong>To bypass a sensor while the system is armed/arming:<br></strong><br>
1. Press the Bypass button and enter your Master Code.<br>
2. Use the arrow buttons to scroll to the sensor you wished to bypass.<br>3. On the first line, the display will show the sensor number and name (ex: SN 1 Front Door).<br>4. Press “OK” to bypass (deactivate) the sensor.<br>5. When a sensor is bypassed, the display shows “Bypassed” on the second line.<br>
<br>
<strong>To bypass a door/window sensor prior to arming:<br></strong><br>
1. Before arming the system, open the desired door or window to be bypassed.<br>
2. Arm your system accordingly.<br>
3. The panel will notify you that the sensor is reporting “Open.”<br>
4. Press the Bypass button.<br>
5. The system will now arm all of the sensors except the one(s) reporting open.

                                    Power outages happen. Unfortunately, not even a Frontpoint system can stop them. However, there is a lot your system can do in the event of one.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Continued Protection</strong> &ndash; Our Control Panel comes with a 24-hour backup battery that keeps your system functioning in the event of a power outage.<br>
<br>
<strong>Outage Notifications</strong> &ndash; Through our interactive features, you will receive a notification 15 minutes after a power outage of the Control Panel being unplugged. If the outage persists for another 10 minutes, you’ll receive a follow-up message with information on the nearby security systems that are also without power. Once power is restored, you’ll be notified.<br>
<br><b>
Setting up outage notifications is easy:</b><br>
<br>
1. Log in to your MyFrontpoint account and set up a new Notification<br>
2. Go to the Notifications tab<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;" class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>• Click New Notification<br>
3. On the Property Awareness sub-tab, select “Your property lost power”<br>

<span style="white-space: pre;" class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>• Choose who to notify when there’s a power failure<br>
<span style="white-space: pre;" class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>• You can sign up for email, text or push notifications<br>
4. Click Save Notification

                                    What is Z-Wave? We’re glad you asked. Z-Wave is a home automation component that allows household products such as lights, door locks and thermostats to communicate wirelessly and be controlled through a phone, tablet or computer. Z-Wave products communicate via low frequency channels, which means there’s no interruption between products.<br>
<br>
So, how can you put Z-Wave to work in your home? There are many ways. For example, our wireless light controls come pre-programmed to work with your system. If you’re interested in learning more about Z-Wave technology and how you can integrate it into your system, give us a call.<br>

                                    If you haven't noticed already, we place quite a bit of emphasis on the simplicity and accessibility of our systems. User codes are a big part of that experience. Unique user codes can be assigned to identify specific users and let you know exactly who is interacting with your system by displaying their designated name.&nbsp;<br>
<br><b>
How to Add User Codes:<br></b>
<br>
1. Log into your MyFrontpoint account<br>
2. Click on the User Code tab<br>
3. Click on the Add User button underneath the current user codes<br>
4. Enter the first and last name of the new user and click Save<br>
5. The new contact should appear in the Address Book. Click on the “Go to User Codes Page” button<br>
6. Enter a user code for the new user and check off the Security Pane Access button to grant the new user access to the Control Panel. Click Save.

                                    1. <strong>Come Home, Lights On</strong> &ndash; You can pair your Wireless Light Control with a Garage Door Sensor, so every time you come home&nbsp; and open the garage, your lights will turn on.<br>
<br>
2. <strong>The Only Way to Start the Morning</strong> &ndash; When you think of a Wireless Light Control and its uses, making coffee doesn’t exactly spring to mind. However, you can do just that. Attach one to your coffeemaker, turn it on remotely via our mobile app, and walk into the kitchen to the smell of fresh-brewed coffee.<br>
<br>
3. <strong>Ending Your Day</strong> &ndash; Attach Wireless Light Controls to TVs and fans and schedule them to turn off right before you drift off to sleep. This allows you to fall asleep comfortably while saving energy throughout the night.

                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    No one likes a false alarm &ndash; not the alarm companies, not emergency responders and certainly not homeowners.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
1. <b>Contractors/Maintenance Workers</b> &ndash;During construction, maintenance or renovation, it’s common for a worker to neglect to disarm a system before beginning work, resulting in false alarms.<br>
<br>
2. <b>Human Error</b> &ndash; Poor placement of sensors during setup has the potential to cause a false alarm. If a sensor is not properly aligned with the magnet, a false alarm can occur.<br>
<br>
3. <b>Cooking</b> &ndash; Excess smoke from cooking can set off a monitored smoke sensor, resulting in a false alarm. Be mindful to ensure proper ventilation when cooking certain items, especially when frying.

                                    Flood damage can be devastating, not to mention costly. By placing a Water and Flood Sensor in an area of your home vulnerable to flooding, you’ll be notified at the first sign of a potential flood, potentially saving you thousands. Common locations for Water and Flood Sensors include:<br>
<strong><br>
Basement Floor</strong> &ndash; Typically, the sensor should be placed on the lowest floor of the home near a water source or where water could enter.<br>
<br>
<strong>Water Heater</strong> &ndash; A common cause of in-home flooding is burst heaters. Place the sensor nearby so it’ll detect the leak quickly, allowing you to shut off the water before the damage is done.<br>
<br>
<strong>Washing Machine </strong>&ndash; A washing machine can also cause flooding via an overflow or bad connection to a leaky water line.<br>
<br>
<strong>Storm Door</strong> &ndash; A storm door is often the first line of defense against floodwater entering the home. Place the sensor by the door and you’ll be alerted instantly of the water makes it past.<br>
